Mini-Project #2

The second mini-project is designed to cover the React concepts learned in modules 6 and 7. The goal is to create an interactive page/s of their choice using React. Ideally the app will include interactive elements such as forms, links and buttons, along with routes, data fetching and various React hooks as needed, as well as external libraries such as bootstrap and MUI.
Here are some questions for the students to cover during their presentations to make sure everything is covered:
- What was your requirements gathering and design process? Was it useful/successful?
- Give a high level overview of your application and its features
- Where does its data come from (external/internal APIs)?
- How does the back end process this data?
- How can the user interact with your application?
- Have you used class components or functional components? Why?
- How have you structured/broken up your components?
- What kinds of React hooks have you used (eg. state, context, effect, navigate)? How?
- What external tools/libraries have you used (eg. bootstrap/axios/MUI)? How? Why?
- How might you extend the features of your application in future?
